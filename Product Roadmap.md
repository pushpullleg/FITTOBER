Certainly! Here’s a **Product Roadmap** for FITOBER Activity Entry Revamp, written from the perspective of a product owner, focusing on deliverable milestones and clarity for developers, organizers, and stakeholders. The plan is phased for impact, each with concrete goals, features, and clear handoff points.

***

## **FITOBER Activity Tracking Revamp — Product Roadmap**

### **Vision**
Deliver a seamless, secure, and scalable activity tracking solution for the FITOBER event, reducing manual work, increasing data integrity, and improving the participant experience. Move from static forms to a dynamic digital platform supporting automation, personalization, and analytics.

***

### **Milestone 1: Immediate Automation (Weeks 1–2)**
**Goal:** Reduce manual effort and errors in the current Google Forms + Sheets workflow.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Google Apps Script to automate data downloads from Form to Sheet.
- Script-based validation checks: duplicate entries, late submissions, and formatting errors flagged in the Sheet.
- Conditional formatting for error spotting in submissions.
- Email script for automatic submission confirmations to participants.
- Prefill-link generation for participant identifiers (unique URL per user where feasible).

**Developer Tasks:**
- Write Google Apps Script for automated nightly (or on-demand) data pulls.
- Implement validation logic within the Sheet.
- Script pre-filled form URL generator.
- Test with live data and deliver to organizers.

***

### **Milestone 2: Process Optimization & Communication (Weeks 3–6)**
**Goal:** Streamline communication, reduce repetitive actions for users, and introduce real-time error prevention.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Enhanced Google Form logic (required fields, dropdowns for valid activities, field validation by activity type, date validation).
- Allow users to edit submissions within a time window.
- Apps Script or Zapier integration for:
  - Scheduled reminder emails to participants (by deadline/day).
  - Automated weekly summary emails or leaderboard updates.
- Shared dashboard (Google Data Studio or integrated Sheet view).

**Developer Tasks:**
- Update form with smarter rules/validation.
- Create scripts/integrations for automated reminders and summaries.
- Configure permission-controlled dashboards for organizers and participants.

***

### **Milestone 3: Integrated Digital Platform Prototype (Months 2–4)**
**Goal:** Develop and launch a minimum viable product (MVP) web application with essential features for an expanded, automation-first workflow.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Secure web portal with SSO (university login or Google Sign-In), eliminating manual CWID/name entry.
- Personalized dashboard for participants: activity history, upcoming events, leaderboard views.
- Admin dashboard for organizers: entry review/flagging, bulk approval, analytics, and messaging.
- Automated validation (submission timing, allowed activity types, duplicate prevention).
- Manual data export functionality for reporting.

**Developer Tasks:**
- Design portal user flows, wireframes, and database schema.
- Build user authentication layer (connect with campus SSO).
- Implement participant and admin dashboards.
- Integrate API for data validation and reporting.
- Conduct a pilot test run with select users/groups for feedback.

***

### **Milestone 4: Mobile & Scalability Phase (Months 4+)**
**Goal:** Extend platform reach and prepare for institutional adoption.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Mobile app or Progressive Web App for on-the-go entry and push notifications.
- Enhanced analytics and reporting for admins; integrate with campus loyalty/rewards if needed.
- API endpoints for potential integration with wearable devices or external fitness trackers.
- Full support/maintenance handoff documentation.

**Developer Tasks:**
- Develop and launch mobile-friendly PWA or native app (as scoped).
- Build new API endpoints as specified in integration requirements.
- Refactor codebase for scalability, performance, and security.
- Prepare handoff and documentation for campus IT/rec department.

***

### **Cross-Cutting Work**
- Gather and incorporate feedback after each release/milestone.
- Regularly update documentation and user help materials.
- Prioritize accessibility and ease-of-use at every stage.

***

**Milestone Review Cadence:**  
At the end of each milestone, hold a review/demo with organizers and a beta tester group. Collect feedback, adjust backlog, and proceed.
