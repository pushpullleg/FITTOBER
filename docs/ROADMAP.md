# FITTOBER Improvement Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap addresses critical pain points in the current FITTOBER system based on hands-on analysis of the Google Form workflow. It provides a phased approach to improve both participant experience and organizer efficiency.

## Current Pain Points

### For Participants
- **Repetitive Data Entry** - Must re-enter CWID, name, and team name with every submission
- **No Personalization** - Form doesn't leverage Google account login or remember past data
- **Manual Effort** - Activity type, minutes, and details must be entered manually each time
- **Feedback Gaps** - No instant confirmation of accumulated logs or access to leaderboard at submission
- **No History** - Cannot view or edit previous submissions

### For Organizers
- **Manual Data Management** - Must download data from Google Forms to Sheets regularly
- **Validation Workload** - Manual checking for duplicates, invalid activities, late submissions
- **Leaderboard Creation** - Weekly summaries compiled and cleaned manually
- **No Real-Time Alerts** - No automatic flags for suspicious, late, or rule-violating entries
- **Error Detection** - Issues only caught after downloading and reviewing data

## Solution Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (Week 1)
