# FITTOBER Documentation

Welcome to the FITTOBER documentation! This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the three solution types designed to address pain points for both participants and organizers of FITTOBER at East Texas A&M University.

## Documentation Index

### 1. [Pain Points Analysis](pain-points-analysis.md)
Detailed analysis of challenges faced by both participants and organizers, including:
- User (participant) pain points and their impact
- Organizer pain points and their impact
- How each solution addresses specific pain points
- Success metrics for measuring improvement

### 2. [Solution Specifications](solution-specifications.md)
Comprehensive specifications for all three solution types:
- **Solution 1: Participant Tracking & Engagement System**
  - Personal dashboard, activity tracking, achievement system, social features, notifications
- **Solution 2: Event Management & Scheduling Platform**
  - Event calendar, registration system, check-in system, communication hub, resource scheduling
- **Solution 3: Progress Monitoring & Analytics Dashboard**
  - Participant analytics, organizer dashboard, intervention alerts, reporting tools, predictive analytics
- Integration points between solutions
- Development priorities (MVP, Phase 2, Future)

### 3. [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md)
Technical architecture and implementation details:
- System architecture diagram
- Component breakdown (frontend, backend, data layer)
- Security considerations
- Scalability strategies
- Technology stack recommendations
- Data flow examples
- Development phases and deployment strategies

## Quick Reference

### For Participants
- Learn how the **Participant Tracking System** helps you stay motivated
- Discover how the **Event Management Platform** simplifies event registration
- See how the **Analytics Dashboard** visualizes your progress

### For Organizers
- Understand how the **Event Management Platform** reduces administrative burden
- Learn how the **Analytics Dashboard** provides actionable insights
- See how the **Participant Tracking System** improves engagement

### For Developers
- Review the **Architecture Overview** for technical implementation details
- Check **Solution Specifications** for feature requirements
- Use **Pain Points Analysis** to understand user needs

## Next Steps

1. **Review** the pain points analysis to understand the problem space
2. **Explore** solution specifications to see how each solution addresses the needs
3. **Study** the architecture overview to plan technical implementation
4. **Start** with the MVP features outlined in the solution specifications
5. **Iterate** based on user feedback and metrics

## Contributing

As this project develops, contribution guidelines will be added. For now, focus on:
- Understanding the documented pain points
- Reviewing the proposed solutions
- Providing feedback on the architecture
- Identifying additional requirements
